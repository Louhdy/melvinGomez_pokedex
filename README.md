# melvinGomez_pokedex

## Description

The repository consists in a web and mobile app that works as a Pokedex showing all Pokemon info listed in https://pokeapi.co/.

## Strategy
For facing this challenge I design a workflow to keep the order of the tasks and also to ensure that every point of the challenge was taking into consideration.

1. Evaluate technologies to use
2. Set up the repository on Github
3. Define stories based on provided design and requirements

Technical requirements: 
React, React Native and TypeScript are mandatory, along with CSS and Tailwind.  

## Getting Started
To run each project enter to the corresponding directory 
```bash
#mobile app
cd app/
yarn expo start

#web app
cd web/
yarn run dev
```

## Anotations
### React Query

React Query is being used to increase site performance as well as making pagination easier to handle

### Ios

The app is properly running on web and ios devices
